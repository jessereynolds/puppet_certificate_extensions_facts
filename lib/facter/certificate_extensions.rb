# This adds custom facts that correspond to each of the X509 certificate extensions
# under Puppet's ppRegCertExt oid namespace, "1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.1". When there are short names defined in
# the puppet agent code in Puppet::SSL::Oids::PUPPET_OIDS the facts will appear with
# the short names as the fact names. Eg:
#
#   $ facter pp_instance_id
#   i-8da75c11
#
# They will also always appear as facts named with oid prefixed with 'certificate_extension_', and with periods translated to underscores Eg:
#
#   $ facter certificate_extension_1_3_6_1_4_1_34380_1_1_2
#   i-8da75c11
#
# See https://docs.puppet.com/puppet/latest/reference/ssl_attributes_extensions.html#puppet-specific-registered-ids for the list of oids with short names defined in the puppet agent.
